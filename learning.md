# colorPicker

I wanted to go through a series of simple JS apps to help reinforce some basic learning and really try and cement some basic fundamentals that could help me in my day to day work life.

> Things I wanted to try and improve for this app: 

 - responsiveness/scalability
 - improving styling 


 > Things I have used in this app that I have never tried before: 

 **calc()** I used this method to handle scaling for containers and font sizes, using a percentage of the viewport width and viewport height. This allowed me to tailor changes in font size and container size in a way that is relative to the window size as it changes.

 **css boiler plate** - I am using a new CSS boiler plate and this gave me a chance to read up on some new ways of defining some basic default settings for my CSS file. An example of this would be the **::before** and **::after** pseudo selectors
